You can run the PHP stuff with:
# php artisan serve 
from the root directory of this project.

YouÂ´ll find three routes for kind of API endpoints:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/s1

http://127.0.0.1:8000/s2

http://127.0.0.1:8000/s3

Each route delivers a different result that needs to be handled with your Vue component.

Task: 

List all data from the backend in an user-friendly and self-explaining manner. Make the data editable. Allow the user to delete and add rows (key/value pairs and key/values pairs). Use VueJS 2.x. Bootstrap-Vue might be of help for you. Figure it out.
